# CSC-256-Samuel-Martinez-Sanchez
Hi, I would like to go by Sam. I work full time in the restaurant industry on the weekends, from Thursday to Sunday. So I apologize for my limited availability. I do attend Wake Tech online Part-Time. Aside from that my hobbies include working out, cooking and playing video games when I can find the time.

Thank you for your time,
-Sam
